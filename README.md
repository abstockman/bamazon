# Bamazon

"Bamazon" is an online store that allows users to select out of 10 items which item they would like to buy. Once the item is selected, the user will then be asked what quantity of the item they would like to purchase. After the transaction is complete, the total cost of the purchase is shown, and the user is prompted whether or not he or she is done shopping.
